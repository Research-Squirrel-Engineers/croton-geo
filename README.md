The PhD Thesis of S. Baars deals with the silver coinage of Croton, an Achaean colony in southern Italy from the 6th - 3rd century BC and examines the material under numismatic, historical as well as archaeological methods to reconstruct the monetary history of the ancient city. Different numismatic methods are used, including those of hoard analysis. In addition to examining the content, the finds were also mapped (Fig. 3/4). The geo-locations of the finds are almost all not exactly georeferenced (e. g. by use of the documentation of excavation reports). The determined locations are derived from literature and have varying degrees of precision regarding the location of the find spot: a reasonably accurate indication, e.g. the hoard of “Tarent 1938” (IGCH 1902) in “via Oberdan” in Taranto, references to modern or ancient city centres, e.g. “Paestum 1937” (IGCH 1925) or “Strongoli 1955” (IGCH 1885), probably in the area of the ancient city of Petelia,  or references to huger regions, e.g. was found in “Calabria” in 1864 (IGCH 1873) or in “South Italy” in 1964 (IGCH 1894) or are from the “Ionian Shore 1908” (IGCH 1916). With these modern and ancient labels, another problem arises, if one wants to mark the site, be it within a city or a whole region: changing borders over time. How, for example, do I mark the region of Calabria (known in Antiquity as “Bruttium”), when no ancient boundaries have been handed down? All in all, how to semantically model the information and how to visualise that on maps?
